Such curves generally follow what is called a power law, thus, they are often said to conform to "the power law of practice". Cognitive psychology has shown that the power law of practice is ubiquitous, and cognitive modeling has explained both the general speedup and variability in performance, which previously was taken to be noise. Research is ongoing to find out why it is ubiquitous and where it does not apply. November},

   abstract = {The performance of many repeated tasks change with experience, with improvement being most rapid at first and then tails off over time until a steady state is reached. The term ‘learning curve’ is often used as shorthand to describe this phenomenon. The objectives of this study were to evaluate individual learning curves for surgeons performing laparoscopic activities for two different tasks important for a surgeon (the nuts and the ropes) that are timed and also to evaluate the possibility of using the information from psychological test and gender in predicting surgical performance. Moreover, it was of interest to know if the measures of performance from the learning curve, psychological test and gender can be used for predicting the results during the 'real life test’. Two-stage analysis was implemented to achieve the stated objectives. In the first stage two approaches were used: the simple method which summarises individual measures by initial measurement, the difference between the first and last measurement or just the final measurement, and the complex analysis. For the complex method, the exponential curve was used to derive the measures of performance of a surgeon from which proxies for learning such as initial level, length of learning, final skill level, rate of learning and time taken to reach a plateau were derived. In the second stage, the proxies for learning were regressed against several covariates. When we look at the training ropes, females performed better than males according to most occasions of measures of performance. Surgeons with higher special cognitive ability were found to have lower starting level. It is also noted that surgeons with larger motivation perform better as compared to those with lower motivation.},

Analyses of practice curve data from a range of paradigms demonstrate that such concerns are well founded for fits of power and exponential functions when the arithmetic average is computed over participants. We also demonstrate that geometric averaging over participants does not, in general, avoid distortion. By contrast, we show that block averages of individual curves and similar smoothing techniques cause little or no distortion of functional form, while still providing the noise reduction benefits that motivate the use of averages. Our analyses are concerned mainly with the effects of averaging on the fit of exponential and power functions, but we also define general conditions that must be met by any set of functions to avoid distortion from averaging.},

We fit power and exponential functions to 40 sets of data representing 7,910 learning series from 475 subjects in 24 experiments. The exponential function fit better than the power function in all the unaveraged data sets. Averaging produced a bias in favor of the power function.

   abstract = {Many models offer different explanations of learning processes, some of them predicting equal learning rates between conditions. The simplest method by which to assess this equality is to evaluate the curvature parameter for each condition, followed by a statistical test. However, this approach is highly dependent on the fitting procedure, which may come with built-in biases difficult to identify. Averaging the data per block of training would help reduce the noise present in the trial data, but averaging introduces a severe distortion on the curve, which can no longer be fitted by the original function. In this article, we first demonstrate what is the distortion resulting from block averaging. The block average learning function, once known, can be used to extract parameters when the performance is averaged over blocks or sessions. The use of averages eliminates an important part of the noise present in the data and allows good recovery of the learning curve parameters. Equality of curvatures can be tested with a test of linear hypothesis. This method can be performed on trial data or block average data, but it is more powerful with block average data.},

The learning curves for individual subjects show an abrupt, often step-like increase from the untrained level of responding to the level seen in the well trained subject. The rise is at least as abrupt as that commonly seen in psychometric functions in stimulus detection experiments. It may indicate that the appearance of conditioned behavior is mediated by an evidence-based decision process, as in stimulus detection experiments. If the appearance of conditioned behavior is taken instead to reflect the increase in an underlying associative strength, then a negligible portion of the function relating associative strength to amount of experience is behaviorally visible. Consequently, rate of learning cannot be estimated from the group-average curve; the best measure is latency to the onset of responding, determined for each subject individually.},

   abstract = {To study the acquisition of perceptual-motor skills as an instance of dynamic pattern formation, we examined the evolution of postural sway and eye and head movements in relation to changes in performance, while 13 novices practiced 3-ball cascade juggling for 9 weeks. Ball trajectories, postural sway, and eye and head movements were recorded repeatedly. Performance improved exponentially, both in terms of the number of consecutive throws and the degree of frequency and phase locking between the ball trajectories. These aspects of performance evolved at different time scales, indicating the presence of a temporal hierarchy in learning. Postural sway, and eye and head movements were often 3:2 and sometimes 3:1 frequency locked to the ball trajectories. As a rule, the amplitudes of these oscillatory processes decreased exponentially at rates similar to that of the increase in the degree of phase locking between the balls. In contrast, the coordination between these oscillatory processes evolved exponentially at different time scales, apart from some erratic evolutions. Collectively, these findings indicate that skill acquisition in the perceptual-motor domain involves multiple time scales and multiform dynamics, both in terms of the development of the goal behavior itself and the evolution of the processes subserving this goal behavior.},

This result has important implications, because it suggests that high noise levels, which are common in psychological experiments, may cause a bias favoring power functions. We replicate their result and extend it by showing strong bias for more realistic sample sizes. We also show that biases occur for data that contain both random and systematic components, as may be expected in real data. We then demonstrate that these biases disappear for two- or three-parameter functions that include linear parameters (in at least one parameterization). Our results suggest that one should exercise caution when proposing simple power and exponential functions as models of learning. More generally, our results suggest that linear parameters should be estimated rather than fixed when one is comparing the fit of nonlinear models to noisy data},

Adult participants (N = 16) learned the tracing task in either a normal or a reversed visual-image condition over 5 consecutive days of practice and then performed 1 day of practice 1 week later and again 1 month later. The reversed-image group's performance was poorer than that of the normal-image group throughout the practice. An exponential was the best fitting function on individual data, but the power-law function was the best fit on the group-averaged data.

   abstract = {Recent work has shown that the power function, a ubiquitous characteristic of learning, memory, and sensation, can emerge from the arithmetic averaging of exponential curves. In the present study, the forgetting process was simulated via computer to determine whether power curves can result from the averaging of other types of component curves. Each of several simulations contained 100 memory traces that were made to decay at different rates. The resulting component curves were then arithmetically averaged to produce an aggregate curve for each simulation. The simulations varied with respect to the forms of the component curves: exponential, range-limited linear, range-limited logarithmic, or power. The goodness of the aggregate curve's fit to a power function relative to other functions increased as the amount of intercomponent slope variability increased, irrespective of component-curve type. Thus, the power law's ubiquity may reflect the pervasiveness of slope variability across component functions. Moreover, power-curve emergence may constitute a methodological artifact, an explanatory construct, or both, depending on the locus of the effect.},

   abstract = {The "law of practice"-a simple nonlinear function describing the relationship between mean response time (RT) and practice-has provided a practically and theoretically useful way of quantifying the speed-up that characterizes skill acquisition. Early work favored a power law, but this was shown to be an artifact of biases caused by averaging over participants who are individually better described by an exponential law. However, both power and exponential functions make the strong assumption that the speedup always proceeds at a steadily decreasing rate, even though there are sometimes clear exceptions. We propose a new law that can both accommodate an initial delay resulting in a slower-faster-slower rate of learning, with either power or exponential forms as limiting cases, and which can account for not only mean RT but also the effect of practice on the entire distribution of RT. We evaluate this proposal with data from a broad array of tasks using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, which pools data across participants while minimizing averaging artifacts, and using inference procedures that take into account differences in flexibility among laws. In a clear majority of paradigms our results supported a delayed exponential law. (PsycINFO Database Record},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased uptake of robotic surgery has led to interest in learning curves for robot-assisted procedures. Learning curves, however, are often poorly defined. This systematic review was conducted to identify the available evidence investigating surgeon learning curves in robot-assisted surgery. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched in February 2018, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, alongside hand searches of key congresses and existing reviews. Eligible articles were those assessing learning curves associated with robot-assisted surgery in patients. RESULTS: Searches identified 2316 records, of which 68 met the eligibility criteria, reporting on 68 unique studies. Of these, 49 assessed learning curves based on patient data across ten surgical specialties. All 49 were observational, largely single-arm (35 of 49, 71 per cent) and included few surgeons. Learning curves exhibited substantial heterogeneity, varying between procedures, studies and metrics. Standards of reporting were generally poor, with only 17 of 49 (35 per cent) quantifying previous experience. Methods used to assess the learning curve were heterogeneous, often lacking statistical validation and using ambiguous terminology. CONCLUSION: Learning curve estimates were subject to considerable uncertainty. Robust evidence was lacking, owing to limitations in study design, frequent reporting gaps and substantial heterogeneity in the methods used to assess learning curves. The opportunity remains for the establishment of optimal quantitative methods for the assessment of learning curves, to inform surgical training programmes and improve patient outcomes.},

   abstract = {Background: Minimally invasive surgery has become popular in recent times and has proved more advantageous than conventional open surgery methods, in terms of maximal preservation of natural anatomy and minimal postoperative complications. However, these advancements require a longer learning curve for inexperienced surgeons. Overview: The learning curve in minimally invasive spine surgery is complex and difficult to measure, and therefore operating times, conversion to open procedures, visual analog scale, and periods of hospital stay are used. In assessing complications as a measure of the learning curve, it was noted that nearly all the complications had been documented previously and became minimum after the 30th consecutive case. As surgical experience increases, perioperative parameters (e.g., operative time and length of hospitalization) improve. The downside of minimally invasive spine surgery is starting unfamiliar procedures without tactile sensation, working in a narrow restricted surgical field, and using endoscopes via two-dimensional imaging. Conclusions: Appropriate instruments, a trained team, and an adept radiographer are important assets for a smooth transition during the learning period. Structured training with cadavers and lots of practice, preferably while working under the guidance of experienced surgeons, is helpful. The learning curve can be shortened when a proficient surgeon gains relevant knowledge, understands three-dimensional anatomy, and has surgical aptitude along with manual dexterity.},

   abstract = {Background: The incorporation of new devices into surgical practice often requires that surgeons acquire and master new skills. We studied the learning curve for intracorporeal knot tying in robotic surgery. Methods: We developed an objective scoring system to evaluate knot tying and tested eight attending surgeons during 3 weeks of training on a surgical robot. Each performed intracorporeal knot tying tasks both before and after robotic skills training. These performances were compared to their laparoscopic knots and analyzed to determine and define skill improvement. Results: Baseline laparoscopic knot completion took 140 sec (range, 47-432), with a mean composite score of 77 (100 possible), whereas robotic knot tying took 390 sec, with a mean composite score of 40. After initial robotic training, times decreased by 65% to 139 sec and scores increased to 71. With more training, completion times and composite scores were improved and errors were reduced. Conclusion: Like any new technology, surgical robotics requires dedicated training to achieve mastery. Initially, even experienced laparoscopists may register an inferior performance. However, after adequate training, surgeons can exceed their laparoscopic performance, completing intracorporeal knots better and faster using robotics.},

   abstract = {Background: Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) is evolving as an important surgical approach in the field of colorectal surgery. We aimed to evaluate the learning curve for RALS procedures involving resections of the rectum and rectosigmoid. Methods: A series of 50 consecutive RALS procedures were performed between August 2008 and September 2009. Data were entered into a retrospective database and later abstracted for analysis. The surgical procedures included abdominoperineal resection (APR), anterior rectosigmoidectomy (AR), low anterior resection (LAR), and rectopexy (RP). Demographic data and intraoperative parameters including docking time (DT), surgeon console time (SCT), and total operative time (OT) were analyzed. The learning curve was evaluated using the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method. Results: The procedures performed for 50 patients (54% male) included 25 AR (50%), 15 LAR (30%), 6 APR (12%), and 4 RP (8%). The mean age of the patients was 54.4 years, the mean BMI was 27.8 kg/m2, and the median American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification was 2. The series had a mean DT of 14 min, a mean SCT of 115.1 min, and a mean OT of 246.1 min. The DT and SCT accounted for 6.3% and 46.8% of the OT, respectively. The SCT learning curve was analyzed. The CUSUMSCT learning curve was best modeled as a parabola, with equation CUSUMSCT in minutes equal to 0.73 × case number2 - 31.54 × case number - 107.72 (R = 0.93). The learning curve consisted of three unique phases: phase 1 (the initial 15 cases), phase 2 (the middle 10 cases), and phase 3 (the subsequent cases). Phase 1 represented the initial learning curve, which spanned 15 cases. The phase 2 plateau represented increased competence with the robotic technology. Phase 3 was achieved after 25 cases and represented the mastery phase in which more challenging cases were managed. Conclusions: The three phases identified with CUSUM analysis of surgeon console time represented characteristic stages of the learning curve for robotic colorectal procedures. The data suggest that the learning phase was achieved after 15 to 25 cases. © The Author(s) 2010.},

   abstract = {Background: Robotic-assisted surgery is used with increasing frequency in general surgery for a variety of applications. In spite of this increase in usage, the learning curve is not yet defined. This study reviews the literature on the learning curve in robotic general surgery to inform adopters of the technology. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE searches yielded 3690 abstracts published between July 1986 and March 2016. The abstracts were evaluated based on the following inclusion criteria: written in English, reporting original work, focus on general surgery operations, and with explicit statistical methods. Results: Twenty-six full-length articles were included in final analysis. The articles described the learning curves in colorectal (9 articles, 35%), foregut/bariatric (8, 31%), biliary (5, 19%), and solid organ (4, 15%) surgery. Eighteen of 26 (69%) articles report single-surgeon experiences. Time was used as a measure of the learning curve in all studies (100%); outcomes were examined in 10 (38%). In 12 studies (46%), the authors identified three phases of the learning curve. Numbers of cases needed to achieve plateau performance were wide-ranging but overlapping for different kinds of operations: 19–128 cases for colorectal, 8–95 for foregut/bariatric, 20–48 for biliary, and 10–80 for solid organ surgery. Conclusion: Although robotic surgery is increasingly utilized in general surgery, the literature provides few guidelines on the learning curve for adoption. In this heterogeneous sample of reviewed articles, the number of cases needed to achieve plateau performance varies by case type and the learning curve may have multiple phases as surgeons add more complex cases to their case mix with growing experience. Time is the most common determinant for the learning curve. The literature lacks a uniform assessment of outcomes and complications, which would arguably reflect expertise in a more meaningful way than time to perform the operation alone.},

   abstract = {Background: Expense, efficiency of use, learning curves, workflow integration and an increased prevalence of serious incidents can all be barriers to adoption. We explored an observational approach and initial diagnostics to enhance total system performance in robotic surgery. Methods: Eighty-nine robotic surgical cases were observed in multiple operating rooms using two different surgical robots (the S and Si), across several specialties (Urology, Gynecology, and Cardiac Surgery). The main measures were operative duration and rate of flow disruptions—described as ‘deviations from the natural progression of an operation thereby potentially compromising safety or efficiency.’ Contextual parameters collected were surgeon experience level and training, type of surgery, the model of robot and patient factors. Observations were conducted across four operative phases (operating room pre-incision; robot docking; main surgical intervention; post-console). Results: A mean of 9.62 flow disruptions per hour (95 % CI 8.78–10.46) were predominantly caused by coordination, communication, equipment and training problems. Operative duration and flow disruption rate varied with surgeon experience (p = 0.039; p < 0.001, respectively), training cases (p = 0.012; p = 0.007) and surgical type (both p < 0.001). Flow disruption rates in some phases were also sensitive to the robot model and patient characteristics. Conclusions: Flow disruption rate is sensitive to system context and generates improvement diagnostics. Complex surgical robotic equipment increases opportunities for technological failures, increases communication requirements for the whole team, and can reduce the ability to maintain vision in the operative field. These data suggest specific opportunities to reduce the training costs and the learning curve.},

   abstract = {Background: Controversy exists as to what constitutes a learning curve to achieve competency, and how the initial learning period of robotic thoracic surgery should be approached. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature published prior to December 2018 using PubMed/MEDLINE for studies of surgeons adopting the robotic approach for anatomic lung resection or thymectomy. Changes in operating room time and outcomes based on number of cases performed, type of procedure, and existing proficiency with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) were examined. Results: Twelve observational studies were analyzed, including nine studies on robotic lung resection and three studies on thymectomy. All studies showed a reduction in operative time with an increasing number of cases performed. A steep learning curve was described for thymectomy, with a decrease in operating room time in the first 15 cases and a plateau after 15–20 cases. For anatomic lung resection, the number of cases to achieve a plateau in operative time ranged between 15–20 cases and 40–60 cases. All but two studies had at least some VATS experience. Six studies reported on experience of over one hundred cases and showed continued gradual improvements in operating room time. Conclusion: The learning curve for robotic thoracic surgery appears to be rapid with most studies indicating the steepest improvement in operating time occurring in the initial 15–20 cases for thymectomy and 20–40 cases for anatomic lung resection. Existing data can guide a standardized robotic curriculum for rapid adaptation, and aid credentialing and quality monitoring for robotic thoracic surgery programs.},

   abstract = {Background: With the rapid adoption of the robotic surgery, more and more learning curve (LC) papers are being published but there is no set definition of what should constitute a rigorous analysis and represent a true LC. A systematic review of the robotic surgical literature was undertaken to determine the range and heterogeneity of parameters reported in studies assessing the LC in robotic surgery. Methods: The search was conducted in July 2017 in PubMed. All studies reporting a LC in robotic surgery were included. 268 (25%) of the identified studies met the inclusion criteria. Results: 102 (38%) studies did not define nor explicitly state the LC with appropriate evidence; 166 studies were considered for quantitative analysis. 46 different parameters of 6 different outcome domains were reported with a median of two parameters (1–8) and 1 domain (1–5) per study. Overall, three domains were only technical and three domains were both technical and clinical/patient-centered outcomes. The two most commonly reported domains were operative time [146 studies (88%)] and intraoperative outcomes [31 studies (19%)]. Postoperative outcomes [16 studies (9%)] and surgical success [11 studies (7%)] were reported infrequently. Purely technical outcomes were the most frequently used to assess LC [131 studies (79%)]. Conclusions: The outcomes reported in studies assessing LC in robotic surgery are extremely heterogeneous and are most often technical indicators of surgical performance rather than clinical and patient-centered outcomes. There is no single outcome that best represents the surgical success. A standardized multi-outcome approach to assessing LC is recommended.},

   abstract = {The transition to performing procedures robotically generally entails a period of adjustment known as a learning curve as the surgeon develops a familiarity with the technology. However, no study has comprehensively examined robotic learning curves across the field of neurosurgery. We conducted a systematic review to characterize the scope of literature on robotic learning curves in neurosurgery, assess operative parameters that may involve a learning curve, and delineate areas for future investigation. PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched. Following deduplication, articles were screened by title and abstract for relevance. Remaining articles were screened via full text for final inclusion. Bibliographic and learning curve data were extracted. Of 746 resultant articles, 32 articles describing 3074 patients were included, of which 23 (71.9%) examined spine, 4 (12.5%) pediatric, 4 (12.5%) functional, and 1 (3.1%) general neurosurgery. The parameters assessed for learning curves were heterogeneous. In total, 8 (57.1%) of 14 studies found reduced operative time with increased cases, while the remainder demonstrated no learning curve. Six (60.0%) of 10 studies reported reduced operative time per component with increased cases, while the remainder indicated no learning curve. Radiation time, radiation time per component, robot time, registration time, setup time, and radiation dose were assessed by ≤ 4 studies each, with 0–66.7% of studies demonstrated a learning curve. Four (44.4%) of 9 studies on accuracy showed improvement over time, while the others indicated no improvement over time. The number of cases required to reverse the learning curve ranged from 3 to 75. Learning curves are common in robotic neurosurgery. However, existing studies demonstrate high heterogeneity in assessed parameters and the number of cases that comprise the learning curve. Future studies should seek to develop strategies to reduce the number of cases required to reach the learning curve.},

   abstract = {With the rapid adoption of robotics in colorectal surgery, there has been growing interest in the pace at which surgeons gain competency, as it may aid in self-assessment or credentialing. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the learning curve of an expert laparoscopic colorectal surgeon who performed a variety of colorectal procedures robotically. This is a retrospective review of a prospective database of 111 subsequent colorectal procedures performed by a single colorectal surgeon. The cumulative summation technique (CUSUM) was used to construct a learning curve for robotic proficiency by analyzing total operative and console times. Postoperative outcomes including length of stay, 30-day complications, and 30-day readmission rates were evaluated. Chi-square and one-way ANOVA (including Kruskal–Wallis) tests were used to evaluate categorical and continuous variables. Our patient cohort had a mean age of 62.4, mean BMI of 26.9, and mean ASA score of 2.41. There were two conversions to open surgery. The CUSUM graph for console time indicated an initial decrease at case 13 and another decrease at case 83, generating 3 distinct performance phases: learning (n = 13), competence (n = 70), and mastery (n = 28). An interphase comparison revealed no significant differences in age, gender, BMI, ASA score, types of procedures, or indications for surgery between the three phases. Over the course of the study, both mean surgeon console time and median length of stay decreased significantly (p = 0.00017 and p = 0.016, respectively). Although statistically insignificant, there was a downward trend in total operative time and postoperative complication rates. Learning curves for robotic colorectal surgery are commonly divided into three performance phases. Our findings contribute to the construction of a reliable learning curve for the transition of colorectal surgeons to robotics. Furthermore, they may help guide the stepwise training and credentialing of new robotic surgeons.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify the stapedotomy learning curve of two U.K. otolaryngologists. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of the outcome of first 100 stapedotomy operations by each surgeon. Included in the study was a postal survey of the incidence of stapes surgery by U.K. otolaryngologists. SETTING: Two tertiary referral centers. PATIENTS: All ears in which primary stapedotomy was performed for otosclerosis. Nonotosclerotic cases and malleus stapedotomy cases were excluded. INTERVENTION: One surgeon used the technique of small fenestra stapedotomy with either a Teflon-wire or titanium piston but without vein graft interposition, whereas the second used the technique of stapedotomy with vein graft interposition and a Teflon piston. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A moving average with a window of 15 dB was used to plot learning curves for the postoperative air-bone gaps. Using a postoperative air-bone gap of 20 dB or better as a definition of 'success,' the success rates with the increase in surgical experience of both surgeons were plotted on graphs, the learning curves. The end point of the learning curve was defined as the point where the curve reached its peak, and the results were sustainable. RESULTS: There was no clear-cut end point in both learning curves, although it appears that there is a landmark point at 60 to 80 cases for both surgeons. Both surgeons also had one "dead ear" in their first 15 cases. The postal survey showed that some trainers only performed small numbers of stapes surgery, whereas some otolaryngologists who performed stapedotomies regularly were not trainers. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports a learning curve in stapes surgery. To maximize the training opportunity of trainee surgeons, it may be advisable for learning centers to form network to provide target training for the trainee who has demonstrated the necessary dexterity and temperament of an otologist. © 2006 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.},

Background: MILS offers benefits compared with open resections. For a safe introduction along the learning curve, formal training is recommended. However, definitions of learning curves and methods to assess it lack standardization. Methods: A systematic review of PubMed, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases identified studies on learning curves in MILS. The primary outcome was the number needed to overcome the learning curve. Secondary outcomes included endpoints defining learning curves and characterization of different learning phases (competency, proficiency, and mastery). Results: Sixty articles with 12,241 patients and 102 learning curve analyses were included. The laparoscopic and robotic approach was evaluated in 71 and 18 analyses and both approaches combined in 13 analyses. Sixty-one analyses (60%) based the learning curve on statistical calculations. The most often used parameters to define learning curves were operative time (n=64), blood loss (n=54), conversion (n=42), and postoperative complications (n=38). Overall competency, proficiency, and mastery were reached after 34 [interquartile range (IQR) 19-56], 50 (IQR 24-74), and 58 (IQR 24-100) procedures, respectively. Intraoperative parameters improved earlier (operative time: competency to proficiency to mastery: -13%, 2%; blood loss: competency to proficiency to mastery: -33%, 0%; conversion rate (competency to proficiency to mastery; -21%, -29%), whereas postoperative complications improved later (competency to proficiency to mastery: -25%, -41%). Conclusions: This review summarizes the highest evidence on learning curves in MILS taking into account different definitions and confounding factors. A standardized 3-phase reporting of learning phases (competency, proficiency, and mastery) is proposed and should be followed.},

   abstract = {Background: Although the "learning curve" is commonly analyzed by splitting the data into arbitrary chunks of experience, this does not allow for precise estimation of where the curve plateaus or the rate at which learning is achieved. Our objective was to describe a simple way to characterize the learning curve for a fundamental laparoscopic task. Methods: Sixteen medical students performed 40 repetitions of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) pegboard task and were scored using validated metrics. A learning curve was plotted and nonlinear regression was used to fit an inverse curve (Y = a - b/X), yielding an estimate of a (asymptote) and b (slope) for each subject. Two values were derived from these estimates: "learning plateau," defined as the theoretical best score achievable (when X = ∞, Y = a) and the "learning rate," defined as the number of trials required to reach 90% of potential (Y = 0.9a when X = 10*b/a). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare subjects reporting an interest in a surgical career (n = 4) to those not interested (n = 4) or undecided (n = 8). Data expressed as mean values ± standard deviations. Results: The raw starting score was 48 ± 24, increasing to 94 ± 8 for the 40th trial. The curve-fitting estimated "learning plateau" was 90 ± 10 (range, 61-99), whereas the "learning rate," or the number of trials to 90% of potential, was 6 ± 2 (range, 2-11). Subjects not interested in a surgical career had lower starting scores and learning plateau and slower learning rate compared with subjects interested in surgery or undecided (ANOVA; P < .05). Conclusion: Fitting an inverse curve allowed for estimation of learning plateau and learning speed for this fundamental laparoscopic task. These parameters allowed for comparisons to be made within subgroups of subjects and may have utility as an outcome for educational interventions designed to impact the learning curve. © 2009 Mosby, Inc.

   abstract = {Aims: There exists a learning curve (LC) with the adoption of any minimally invasive surgical (MIS) technique with implications for training, implementation, and evaluation. A standardized approach to describing and analyzing LCs in pediatric MIS is lacking. We sought to determine how pediatric MIS LCs are quantified and present a framework for reporting. Methods: Systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE 1985-October 2015 for articles describing MIS in the pediatric population and presenting formal analysis of the LC. Articles screened by two independent reviewers. Results: Twenty-nine articles (n = 17 general abdominal/thoracic, n = 12 urological) from an 18-year period (1997-2015) were included representing 3345 procedures (n = 3116 laparoscopic, n = 10 thoracoscopic, n = 219 robotic). Seven (24%) were prospective, three multicenter. Twenty-two (76%) presented data pertaining to >1 operating surgeon. Operative time was the most commonly employed surrogate of proficiency (n = 26 [90%] studies). Twenty (69%) described >1 LC outcome measure. Sixteen additional measures were described, including conversion (n = 12 studies); blood loss (n = 4 studies); complications (n = 10 studies); and postoperative outcomes (n = 14 studies). Three studies assessed impact of LC on trainees and one considered economic impact. LCs were presented in tabular form (n = 14 studies) and graphically (n = 19). Eleven (38%) studies undertook statistical appraisal utilizing comparative statistics (n = 8 studies) and regression analysis (n = 4 studies). Conclusions: Multiple outcome measures of proficiency are employed in reporting pediatric MIS experience and analysis of LCs is inconsistent. A standardized multioutcome approach to reporting should be encouraged. In addition, attempts should be made to quantify the impact on trainee involvement. We present an idealized framework for reporting.},

   abstract = {Background and Aims: Procedures for urolithiasis are a core part of the development for the urologist in training. Understanding the learning curve of the procedures is important, allowing for planning in the training and assessment of trainees. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature pertaining to learning curves in urolithiasis surgery. Materials and Methods: The review was registered on the PROSPERO database and conducted in keeping with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were systematically searched from inception to January 2018, with a reference review conducted. All empirical studies on learning curves in urolithiasis surgery were included irrespective of procedure. Articles describing pediatric surgery, nontechnical skills in surgery, or those not written in English were excluded. Results: Of 390 articles identified from screening, a final 18 studies were included. Fourteen studies identified the learning curve in percutaneous nephrolithotomy. These studies identified a learning curve of between 30 and 60 cases for both operative time (OT) and complication rates. Four articles focused on flexible ureteroscopy (FURS); the learning curve for FURS has been outlined as 60 cases for OT and 56 cases for fragmentation efficacy. Conclusions: The complexities of determining learning curves are extensive; studies use different parameters to measure outcomes and observe skill acquisition rates of surgeons with differing prior experience. Evidence in this article can guide trainee urologists with regard to the expected rate of progress. Multi-operator multicenter research utilizing standard outcome measures should be conducted to establish definitive learning curves.},

   abstract = {Objective To determine the number of cases a urological surgeon must complete to achieve proficiency for various urological procedures. Patient and Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases were systematically searched for studies published up to December 2011. Studies pertaining to learning curves of urological procedures were included. Two reviewers independently identified potentially relevant articles. Procedure name, statistical analysis, procedure setting, number of participants, outcomes and learning curves were analysed. Results Forty-four studies described the learning curve for different urological procedures. The learning curve for open radical prostatectomy ranged from 250 to 1000 cases and for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy from 200 to 750 cases. The learning curve for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) has been reported to be 40 procedures as a minimum number. Robot-assisted radical cystectomy has a documented learning curve of 16-30 cases, depending on which outcome variable is measured. Irrespective of previous laparoscopic experience, there is a significant reduction in operating time (P = 0.008), estimated blood loss (P = 0.008) and complication rates (P = 0.042) after 100 RALPs. Conclusions The available literature can act as a guide to the learning curves of trainee urologists. Although the learning curve may vary among individual surgeons, a consensus should exist for the minimum number of cases to achieve proficiency. The complexities associated with defining procedural competence are vast. The majority of learning curve trials have focused on the latest surgical techniques and there is a paucity of data pertaining to basic urological procedures.},

   abstract = {Objective: To provide a multidimensional analysis of the learning curve in major laparoscopic colonic and rectal surgery and compare outcomes between right-sided versus left-sided resections. Summary Background Data: The laparoscopic learning curve is known to vary between surgeons, may be influenced by the patient selection and operative complexity, and requires appropriate case-mix adjustment. Methods: This is a descriptive single-center study using routinely collected clinical data from 900 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery between November 1991 and April 2003. Outcome measures included operation time, conversion rate (CR), and readmission and postoperative complication rates. Multifactorial logistic regression analysis was used to identify patient-, surgeon-, and procedure-related factors associated with conversion of laparoscopic to open surgery. A risk-adjusted Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) model was used for evaluating the learning curve for right and left-sided resections. Results: The conversion rate for right-sided colonic resections was 8.1% (n = 457) compared with 15.3% for left-sided colorectal resections (n = 443). Independent predictors of conversion of laparoscopic to open surgery were the body mass index (BMI) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07 per unit increase), ASA grade (OR = 1.63 per unit increase), type of resection (left colorectal versus right colonic procedures, OR = 1.5), presence of intra-abdominal abscess (OR = 5.0) or enteric fistula (OR = 4.6), and surgeon's experience (OR 0.9 per 10 additional cases performed). Having adjusted for case-mix, the CUSUM analysis demonstrated a learning curve of 55 cases for right-sided colonic resections versus 62 cases for left-sided resections. Median operative time declined with operative experience (P < 0.001). Readmission rates and postoperative complications remained unchanged throughout the series and were not dependent on operative experience. Conclusions: Conversion rates for laparoscopic colectomy are dependent on a multitude of factors that require appropriate adjustment including the learning curve (operative experience) for individual surgeons. The laparoscopic model described can be used as the basis for performance monitoring between or within institutions. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

   abstract = {Objective: To clarify and quantify the potential dose- response association between the intake of fruit and vegetables and risk of type 2 diabetes.
Design: Meta-analysis and systematic review of prospective cohort studies.
Data source: Studies published before February 2014 identified through electronic searches using PubMed and Embase.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Prospective cohort studies with relative risks and 95% CIs for type 2 diabetes according to the intake of fruit, vegetables, or fruit and vegetables.
Results: A total of 10 articles including 13 comparisons with 24 013 cases of type 2 diabetes and 434 342 participants were included in the metaanalysis. Evidence of curve linear associations was seen between fruit and green leafy vegetables consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes (p=0.059 and p=0.036 for non-linearity, respectively). The summary relative risk of type 2 diabetes for an increase of 1 serving fruit consumed/day was 0.93 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.99) without heterogeneity among studies (p=0.477, I2=0%). For vegetables, the combined relative risk of type 2 diabetes for an increase of 1 serving consumed/ day was 0.90 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.01) with moderate heterogeneity among studies (p=0.002, I2=66.5%). For green leafy vegetables, the summary relative risk of type 2 diabetes for an increase of 0.2 serving consumed/day was 0.87 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.93) without heterogeneity among studies (p=0.496, I2=0%). The combined estimates showed no significant benefits of increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables combined.
Conclusions: Higher fruit or green leafy vegetables intake is associated with a significantly reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.},

Operating times were collected and related to the number of procedures done by residents performing closed reduction and internal fixation using cannulated screws for intracapsular fractures of the hip and cephalomedullary nailing for trochanteric fractures, as well as hemiarthroplasty for displaced intracapsular fractures. The mean operating times decreased significantly for all four procedures studied, though at different rates. For cannulated screws, the mean duration of surgery decreased from 47.8 minutes to 30.1 minutes for procedures 21-25. For cephalomedullary nailing without distal locking, the mean operating time decreased from 73.3 minutes to 36.3 minutes. For cephalomedullary nailing with distal locking, the mean operating time decreased from 81.7 minutes to 56.9 minutes. The mean operating time for hemiarthroplasty decreased from 97.3 minutes to 66.0 minutes. Mean operating times decreased significantly for all procedures studied, though at different rates, indicating a unique learning curve for each procedure. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Objectives. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the learning curve (LC) literature and identify the LC of cardiothoracic and vascular surgical procedures. Summary and background. The LC describes an observation that a learner’s performance improves over time during acquisition of new motor skills. Measuring the LC of surgical procedures has important implications for surgical innovation, education, and patient safety. Numerous studies have investigated LCs of isolated operations in cardiothoracic and vascular surgeries, but a lack of uniformity in the methods and variables used to measure LCs has led to a lack of systematic reviews. Methods. The MEDLINE®, EMBASETM, and PsycINFO® databases were systematically searched until July 2013. Articles describing LCs for cardiothoracic and vascular procedures were included. The type of procedure, statistical analysis, number of participants, procedure setting, level of participants, outcomes, and LCs were reviewed. Results. A total of 48 studies investigated LCs in cardiothoracic and vascular surgeries. Based on operating time, the LC for coronary artery bypass surgery ranged between 15 and 100 cases; for endoscopic vessel harvesting and other cardiac vessel surgery between 7 and 35 cases; for valvular surgery, which included repair and replacement, between 20 and 135 cases; for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, between 15 and 35 cases; for vascular neurosurgical procedures between 100 and 500 cases, based on complications; for endovascular vessel repairs between 5 and 40 cases; and for ablation procedures between 25 and 60 cases. However there was a distinct lack of standardization in the variables/outcome measures used, case selection, prior experience, and supervision of participating surgeons and a range of statistical analyses to compute LCs was noted. Conclusion. LCs in cardiothoracic and vascular procedures are hugely variable depending on the procedure type, outcome measures, level of prior experience, and methods/statistics used. Uniformity in methods, variables, and statistical analysis is needed to derive meaningful comparisons of LCs. Acknowledgment and application of learning processes other than those reliant on volume-outcomes relationship will benefit LC research and training of surgeons.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To perform a systematic search and review of the available literature on the learning curves (LCs) in laparoscopic and robot-assisted prostate surgery. Methods: Medline was systematically searched from 1946 to January 2021 to detect all studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement, reporting on the LC in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP), laparoscopic simple prostatectomy (LSP), robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and robot-assisted simple prostatectomy (RSP). Results: In total, 47 studies were included for qualitative synthesis evaluating a single technique (LRP, RARP, LSP, RSP; 45 studies) or two techniques (LRP and RARP; 2 studies). All studies evaluated outcomes on real patients. RARP was the most widely investigated technique (30 studies), followed by LRP (17 studies), LSP (1 study), and RSP (1 study). In LRP, the reported LC based on operative time; estimated blood loss; length of hospital stay; positive surgical margin; biochemical recurrence; overall complication rate; and urinary continence rate ranged 40–250, 80–250, 58–200, 50–350, 110–350, 55–250, 70–350 cases, respectively. In RARP, the corresponding ranges were 16–300, 20–300, 25–200, 50–400, 40–100, 20–250, 30–200, while LC for potency rates was 80–90 cases. Conclusions: The definition of LC for laparoscopic and robot-assisted prostate surgery is not well defined with various metrics used among studies. Nevertheless, LCs appear to be steep and continuous. Implementation of training programs/standardization of the techniques is necessary to improve outcomes.},

There is currently no standardised surgical training for those willing to make their first attempts at minimally invasive pancreatic surgery. This study aims to ascertain the learning curve in minimally invasive pancreatic surgery. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science was performed up to March 2021. Studies investigating the number of cases needed to achieve author-declared competency in minimally invasive pancreatic surgery were included. Results: In total, 31 original studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria with 2682 patient outcomes being analysed. From these studies, the median learning curve for distal pancreatectomy was reported to have been achieved in 17 cases (10–30) and 23.5 cases (7–40) for laparoscopic and robotic approach respectively. The median learning curve for pancreaticoduodenectomy was reported to have been achieved at 30 cases (4–60) and 36.5 cases (20–80) for a laparoscopic and robotic approach respectively. Mean operative times and estimated blood loss improved in all four surgical procedural groups. Heterogeneity was demonstrated when factoring in the level of surgeon’s experience and patient’s demographic. Conclusions: There is currently no gold standard in the evaluation of a learning curve. As a result, derivations are difficult to utilise clinically. Existing literature can serve as a guide for current trainees. More work needs to be done to standardise learning curve assessment in a patient-centred manner.},

With increasing awareness of both the public and the surgical community on patient safety, optimization of training has gained importance. For implementation of MIPS we propose 3 training phases. The first phase focuses on developing basic skills and procedure specific skills with the help of simulation, biotissue drills, video libraries, live case observations, and training courses. The second phase consists of index procedures, fellowships, and proctoring programs to ensure patient safety during the first procedures. During the third phase the surgeons aim is to safely implement the procedure into standard practice while minimizing learning curve related excess morbidity and mortality. Case selection, skills assessment, feedback, and mentoring are important methods to optimize this phase. The residual learning curve can reach up to 100 cases depending on the surgeons' previous experience, selection of cases, and definition of the parameters used to assess the learning curve. Adequate training and high procedural volume are key to implementing MIPS safely.},
